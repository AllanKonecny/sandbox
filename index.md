This is my sandbox site that contains various demos and examples
that don't really fit any main projects I'm working on.  Most of it is a scratch pad that
might roll into a project or be parts I need to test out more.  Generally, my blog, 
[BenKnowsCode](http://benknowscode.wordpress.com/) will reference this site.

The site was generated by Jekyll and I started it using Jekyll-Bootstrap.  Since I didn't 
need the blog aspect, I spent some time figuring out how to tweak it for a hierarchy of
pages.  I wanted to organize everything into projects so I leveraged the "group" meta-data
on my pages to organize my pages.  JB already has a template that will render a list of
pages with a specific group so I setup basic path of navigation > projects > projectA and
put my pages in corresponding directories.

* To see how I set this up in the source, [look at it in GitHub](https://github.com/bseth99/bseth99.github.com/).
