{% include JB/setup %}

This is my sandbox site that contains various demos and examples
that don't really fit any main projects I'm working on.  Most of it is a scratch pad that
might roll into a project or be parts I need to test out more.  Generally, my blog, 
[BenKnowsCode]({{ site.blog_url }}) will reference this site.

The site was generated by Jekyll and I started it using Jekyll-Bootstrap.  Since I didn't 
need the blog aspect, I spent some time figuring out how to tweak it for a hierarchy of
pages.  I wanted to organize everything into projects so I leveraged the "group" meta-data
on my pages to organize my pages.  JB already has a template that will render a list of
pages with a specific group so I setup basic path of navigation > projects > projectA and
put my pages in corresponding directories.

Addtionally, since I had to add custom plugins to Jekyll, it won't render correctly via the
hosted GitHub Jekyll so I created a separate repo for the source and then push the generated
content to my pages repo.

* To see how I set this up in the source, [look at it in GitHub](https://github.com/bseth99/sandbox/).
* To learn more about how I setup this site, [look at this blog post]({{ site.blog_url }}/2012/08/using-jekyll-to-create-site-on-github_2028.html).
