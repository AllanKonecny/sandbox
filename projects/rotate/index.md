title: CSS3 Transforms and Various Alignment Issues with jQuery

{% include JB/setup %}


The project is a series of tests to determine how to use jQuery to apply the CSS3 tranforms,
find points on that rotated element, and align it with another element.  
The primary objective is to align elements to a circular path.

You can read more about this these tests [on my blog]({{ site.blog_url}}).
