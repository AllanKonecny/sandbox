title: jQuery - CSS Transforms, Alignment, and Animating on a Circular Path
group: projects

{% include JB/setup %}

The project is a series of tests to determine how to use jQuery to apply the CSS3 tranform: rotate style,
find points on that rotated element, align it with another element, and create animations on a circular
path.  The studies are the ground work for another project which will leverage the knowledge obtained from
these tests.
