    <div class="discussion">
     This page shows how to chain the built-in jQuery UI widgets Draggable and Resizable to
     create specific functionality using those simple building blocks.  This demo is referenced in several
     of my blog posts related to the jQuery UI Widget series at
       <a href="{{ site.blog_url }}/category/projects/jquery-ui-widgets/"
          >BenKnowsCode.wordpress.com</a>

    </div>

    <div class="target">

    </div>

<script>

$(function()
{
   $('<div>colorbox</div>').appendTo($('.target'))
        .css(
         {
            height: '100px',
            width: '100px',
            backgroundColor: 'green'
         })
        .resizable(
         {
            maxHeight: 500,
            maxWidth: 500,
            minHeight: 100,
            minWidth: 100
         })
        .draggable(
         {
            grid: [50, 50],
            stop: function (e, ui)
             {
                alert('done dragging!');
             }
         });
});
