Ben's Sandbox Site
==================

This is the repository for my sandbox site that contains various demos and examples
that don't really fit any main projects I'm working on.  Most of it is a scratch pad that
might roll into a project or be parts I need to test out more.  Generally, my blog 
[BenKnowsCode](http://benknowscode.wordpress.com/) will reference this site.

I wanted to try out Jekyll to create a site on GitHub, so this serves as a test bed for that
experience as well
